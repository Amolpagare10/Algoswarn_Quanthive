# ❄️ The problem ICE BATHE solves

Stock trading can be overwhelming for beginners because of the complexity involved in analyzing the market, identifying good trade signals, and managing risks. Many existing strategies require deep financial knowledge and advanced coding skills.

Our strategy simplifies this by using **Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossovers**, a well-known and reliable technique in technical analysis. We have optimized the fast and slow moving average parameters to maximize returns and minimize risks.

## ⭐ Key Benefits:

- 🧑‍🏫 **Beginner-friendly:** Any newcomer in stock trading can easily implement our code without advanced knowledge.
- 📈 **Profit-driven:** The optimized EMA crossover settings are designed to catch strong trends and generate consistent profits.
- ⚡ **Plug-and-play:** Users can start using the strategy immediately with minimal setup, making stock trading more accessible.
- 🔧 **Adaptable:** The strategy can be customized for different stocks and market conditions.

In summary, our solution allows beginners to trade confidently using a proven strategy, automating complex analysis and helping them make smarter trading decisions. 🚀

# 🧩 Challenges we ran into

While building this project, we faced several key challenges that required significant effort and learning to overcome.

Firstly, our strategy initially resulted in **low or negative returns**, a **negative alpha**, and **high drawdowns**, making it impractical for real-world trading. To address this, we refined the EMA parameters and experimented with various fast–slow combinations. We ran multiple backtests and analyzed key metrics such as returns, alpha, beta, and drawdown to identify the optimal configuration. 🔍📊

Apart from this, we initially faced difficulties in operating and setting up **Blueshift** for algorithmic trading simulations. Understanding the platform and integrating our strategy was challenging. However, we overcame this obstacle by attending online workshops and referring to detailed tutorials provided by the Algoswarm team, which greatly helped us in understanding the workflow and fine-tuning our strategy. 🎓🛠️

Through these iterations and learnings, we were able to develop a **more robust, profitable, and efficient trading strategy**. 💡💹
